            What happens in an electoral voting is that the one vote is equivalent to one value.
            In this project, a process is described how blockchain is used to communicate between two peers and further run the process.
            Here we consider one of the peer as one candidate and the other as voter.
            Now our project is based on how can we asure more security for the votes received and make this electoral voting system more secure and accurate.
             We will explain how this project is more strong, secure and accurate.
            There are already many blockchain technologies for instance Ethereum, 
            Multichain etc which can be used in voting machines.
            And finally in this project we are going to show you how to design, all about the architecture, its advantages, limitations, mechanism and usage in our lifestyle.
